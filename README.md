Welcome to NebulaVR! A virtual reality IDE for the [Nebula Language](https://github.com/CapnSquirrel/nebula). The language uses multidimensional logical constructs to perform actions between nodes. These nodes are powerful; rather than simply holding data and linking to other structures, they can trigger actions on the global environment and ultimately cause the execution of functions whose return values may ripple back to the original node.

Though it borrows some ideas from some of these well-known programming languages, Nebula also offers a new programming paradigm, "spatial programming", an intuitive and fresh way to work with scoping. In virtual reality, programmers are able to see how Nebula components interact with each other and are able to link inputs and outputs in real time. All nodes are identified, tracked, and compiled by their position vector in 3D space. Users are free to spawn and manipulate function blocks with their controllers.
